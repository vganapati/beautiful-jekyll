<p>My research on solar cells and thermophotovoltaics is supported by the <a href="http://lmi.caltech.edu/">Light-Material Interactions in Energy Conversion "EFRC,"</a> a collaboration between Lawrence Berkeley Lab, Caltech, UIUC, Harvard, and Stanford, funded by the Department of Energy.</p>

 <p>The MIT infrared birefringence work was done in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.en.iwm.fraunhofer.de/">Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials</a> in Halle, Germany, where I spent a summer through the support of <a href="http://web.mit.edu/misti/mit-germany/">MISTI-Germany</a>.</p>
