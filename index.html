<p>I'm an Assistant Professor of Engineering at <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College</a>. Formerly, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at <a href="http://verily.com">Verily (formerly Google[x])</a>, 
working on the robotic surgery team. I received my Ph.D in <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at the 
University of California, Berkeley</a>, advised by <a href="http://optoelectronics.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Prof. Eli Yablonovitch</a>. My graduate work centered 
on the optimization and thermodynamics of high efficiency photovoltaics and was supported
by the <a href="http://science.energy.gov/wdts/scgf/2010-cohort-profiles/">Department of Energy Office of Science Graduate Fellowship</a> and the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship.
</p>


<p>My current research interests include applying optimization, machine learning, and simulation to optical system design, with applications in medical and biological imaging. </p>
