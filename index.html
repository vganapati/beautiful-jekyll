<p>I'm a Postdoctoral Associate at <a href="http://verily.com">Verily (formerly Google[x]) Life Sciences</a>, 
working on the robotic surgery team. I received my Ph.D in <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at the 
University of California, Berkeley</a>, advised by <a href="http://optoelectronics.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Prof. Eli Yablonovitch</a>. My graduate work centered 
around the optimization and thermodynamics of high efficiency photovoltaics and was supported
by the <a href="http://science.energy.gov/wdts/scgf/2010-cohort-profiles/">Department of Energy Office of Science Graduate Fellowship</a> and the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship.
My undergraduate research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was advised by <a href="http://pv.mit.edu/">Prof. Tonio Buonassisi</a> and 
focused on imaging microcrystalline defects in multicrystalline silicon with infrared birefringence.</p>

<p>I'm interested in applying optimization algorithms to everything, from photovoltaics to medical imaging.</p>
