<p>I'm a Postdoctoral Associate at <a href="http://verily.com">Verily (formerly Google[x] Life Sciences)</a>, 
working on the robotic surgery team. I received my Ph.D in <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at the 
University of California, Berkeley</a>, advised by <a href="http://optoelectronics.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Prof. Eli Yablonovitch</a>. My graduate work centered 
on the optimization and thermodynamics of high efficiency photovoltaics and was supported
by the <a href="http://science.energy.gov/wdts/scgf/2010-cohort-profiles/">Department of Energy Office of Science Graduate Fellowship</a> and the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship.
My undergraduate research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was advised by <a href="http://pv.mit.edu/">Prof. Tonio Buonassisi</a> and 
focused on imaging microdefects in multicrystalline silicon with infrared birefringence.</p>


<p>My research interests include applying optimization algorithms to applications in photovoltaics, renewable energy systems, and bioimaging. 
I enjoy teaching, and recently was a summer instructor for <a href="http://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code.</a></p>
