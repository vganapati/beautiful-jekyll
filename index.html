<p>I'm a Postdoctoral Associate at [Verily (formerly Google[x]) Life Sciences]("verily.com"), 
working on the robotic surgery team. I received my Ph.D in [Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at the 
University of California, Berkeley]("http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/"), advised by [Prof. Eli Yablonovitch]("http://optoelectronics.eecs.berkeley.edu/"). My graduate work centered 
around the optimization and thermodynamics of high efficiency photovoltaics and was supported
by the [Department of Energy Office of Science Graduate Fellowship]("http://science.energy.gov/wdts/scgf/2010-cohort-profiles/") and the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship.
My undergraduate research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was advised by [Prof. Tonio Buonassisi]("http://pv.mit.edu/") and 
focused on imaging microcrystalline defects in multicrystalline silicon with infrared birefringence.</p>

<p>I'm interested in applying optimization algorithms to everything, from photovoltaics to medical imaging.</p>
