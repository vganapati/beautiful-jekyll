[Girls Who Code](http://girlswhocode.com/summer-immersion-programs/) (Summer 2015)  
I taught the Summer Immersion Program, an intensive 7-week computer science course for 20 rising high school junior and senior girls.
We were hosted by [Square](https://squareup.com/). Some of the amazing final projects completed by the girls include [Boba Buddies](http://bobabuddies.github.io) and [AmplifEye](http://theamplifeyers.github.io/). 

[Technovation Challenge](http://www.technovationchallenge.org/) (Spring 2012)  
I worked with a group of 100 high school girls and helped them create mobile apps in [App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/), as well as business plans go along with their apps.
We were hosted by Twitter and the program culminated in the teams "pitching" their apps.
